      <p>Anime is not foreign to me. </p>
        
      <p>Since I was a kid, I read Naruto, One Piece, Doraemon, Dragon Ball, Dr. Slump, and a ton of classics.</p>
      <p>Now, I never considered myself a hard-core anime lover. Maybe it&rsquo;s because of the ‚Äúnegative‚Äù association with it (weeb dx). Or maybe it&rsquo;s just my internal thoughts messing with me.</p>  
      <p>But, in the past year, I&rsquo;ve been watching a lot more anime. And I mean - A LOT MORE. I guess I just stopped caring about what other people think of me (tbh it&rsquo;s hard). I can decide what I like and don&rsquo;t like. I just like to watch anime!</p>
      <p>So, I created this site to accomplish two things:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Brush up my basic semantic HTML & CSS skills</li>
        <li>Share everything anime-related about me (watched, in progress, bucket list, favorites)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Lowkey I just want this to be a fun coding project lmao so please bare with me üòå</p> 
      <p>üî¥ Beware: long article + there are some spoilers!</p>

      <h2 id="top-5">My Top 5 (So Far) + Honorable Mentions</h2>
      <p>Okay actually this is a bit cheating because I have more than 5 in this ‚Äútop 5‚Äù list. You&rsquo;ll see why.</p>
      <p>At the moment, what I value in an anime is this:</p>
      <blockquote>Do I feel something after watching it? </blockquote>
      <p>You can call it impact, underlying message, the feels, or whatever make sense.</p>
      <p>Now, this doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t care about the art style, storyline, character development, etc. In fact, I value those greatly. I do take everything into account.</p>
      <p>It&rsquo;s just that for me - the feels is a huge bonus. </p>
      <p>Now, before we get into it, I want to mention some honorable mentions.</p>
      <article>
        <h3>Honorable Mention 1: To Your Eternity</h3>
        <img src="article/fushi.jpg" alt="fushi crying" width="100%" height="100%">
        <p>The only reason ‚ÄúTo Your Eternity‚Äù is not in my top 5 is:</p>
        <blockquote>I just wasn&rsquo;t that invested after Gugu&rsquo;s scene.</blockquote>
        <img src="article/fushi and gugu.jpg" alt="fushi and gugu on the balcony chatting" width="100%" height="100%">
        <p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong - I ‚Äúfelt‚Äù it in both March & Gugu&rsquo;s stories, especially March. It was soul-wrenching.</p>
        <img src="article/fushi and march.jpg" alt="angry march walking in front of fushi" width="100%" height="100%">
        <p>The art is gorgeous, and the anime concept is unique. Maybe it&rsquo;s just the feeling didn&rsquo;t carry out in the remaining of season 1 and season 2.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Honorable Mention 2: The Promised Neverland Season 1</h3>
        <figure>
          <img src="article/emma, ray, norman.jpg" alt="emma, ray, and norman holding a lantern in the dark" width="100%" height="100%">
          <figcaption>Is...someone going to jump out behind them?</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The Promised Neverland is one of those anime that kept me on the edge of my seat. The ‚Äúmoms‚Äù were so damn creepy. And the whole backstory is creepy.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="article/mom.jpg" alt="promised neverland mom smiling" width="100%" height="100%">
          <figcaption>That smile...</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>There&rsquo;s just a luring sense of creepiness in this anime. And it&rsquo;s illustrated so well.</p>
        <p>However, the only drawback is the Season 2 anime. I&rsquo;m sure that, at this point, it&rsquo;s pretty unanimous that season 2 anime was a tragedy.</p>
        <p>The manga was good, but at that point, I lost faith in it. Still, season 1 anime was incredible.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Honorable Mention 3: Naruto, One Piece, Black Clover, Demon Slayer</h3>
        <img src="article/honorable mention 3.jpg" alt="naruto, one piece, black clover, and demon slayer cover" width="100%" height="100%">
        <p>It was hard to put these on my top 5. Not because I don&rsquo;t like them. These are special anime to me - especially Naruto and One Piece.</p>
        <p>But, these are the ones I consider ‚Äúextremely long‚Äù anime. The result of its length is that there are inevitably boring segments.</p>
        <p>So I guess these deserve a separate category of ‚Äúlong anime that I like.‚Äù Not sure. I just felt like the need to acknowledge them in some way because they were important to me.</p>
        <p>Now, with those mentions, let&rsquo;s get into my top 5.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>No.5 - Violet Evergarden ‚úâÔ∏è / Made in Abyss üóª</h3>
        <img src="article/number 5.jpg" alt="violet evergarden and made in abyss cover" width="100%" height="100%">
        <p>Boom - 2 number 5 picks. Oops.</p>
        <p>In all honesty, this was extremely hard.</p>
        <p>For me, Violet Evergarden brings a bit of nostalgic value. It was my first entryway into ‚Äúnon-mainstream‚Äù anime (Naruto, One Piece, etc).</p>
        <p>And man was it a beautiful ride. Violet Evergarden has arguably the most beautiful art style I have ever seen.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="article/violet evergarden 1.jpg" alt="violet holding up and staring at her bandaged hand" width="100%" height="100%">
          <figcaption>Just look at this art ü•∫</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>But, what I think is most special about it is that it questions the subtle & ‚Äúnormal‚Äù things that we as humans do, such as detecting the underlying message behind someone&rsquo;s words.</p>
        <img src="article/violet evergarden 2.jpg" alt="violet on the gondala heading down" width="100%" height="100%">
        <p>On the other hand, Made in Abyss is also beautiful, but more in the sense of fantasy-beautiful. There are so many out-of-this-world concepts and some‚Ä¶very dark ones too.</p>
        <img src="article/made in abyss 1.jpg" alt="Riko, Reg, and Nanachi staring in front" width="100%" height="100%">
        <p>The scene where one of the main characters got hurt (iykyk). That was horrific‚Ä¶</p>
        <p>And I want to say - Bondrewd is one of the most well-designed and disgusting villain I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I say well-designed because I felt bit of sadness when he died (?).</p>
        <img src="article/made in abyss 3.jpg" alt="bondrewd and his crew" width="100%" height="100%">
        <p>In short, it&rsquo;s just hard to pick. So number 5 goes to both.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>No.4 - Summertime Rendering üî´</h3>
        <img src="article/summertime rendering 1.jpg" alt="Shinpei, Ushio, and Mio fighting the shadow" width="100%" height="100%">
        <p>Oof this was SO DAMN GOOD.</p>
        <p>Definitely one of my top mystery anime so far. There were so many unexpected bits & storylines. And I remember being on the edge of my seat for so many episodes.</p>
        <img src="article/summertime rendering 2.jpg" alt="Shinpei standing next to Ushio about to shoot himself" width="100%" height="100%">
        <p>But, I instantly knew this would be one of my favorites at this moment:</p>
        <blockquote>When I realized how satisfying the last episode felt.</blockquote>
        <figure>
          <img src="article/summertime rendering 3.jpg" alt="main characters of summertime rendering taking a group photo" width="100%" height="100%">
          <figcaption>Just look at them... They definitely did not go over hardship...right?</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>And that was also when I realized how absorbed I was in the anime and, of course, all the tension, drama, and build-ups. It&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="article/summertime rendering 4.jpg" alt="shiori crying" width="100%" height="100%">
          <figcaption>iykyk üò¨</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>BUT! Quick caveat - I do feel like the villain near the end of the anime is way too shallow and the battle scenes took me out of it. But regardless, still one of my favs!</p>
      </article>

        <h3>No.3 - Bocchi the Rock üé∏ / Kaguya Sama üíò</h3>
        <img src="article/number 3.jpg" alt="bocchi the rock and kaguya sama cover" width="100%" height="100%">
        <p>Oh man - can I just say:</p>
        <blockquote>Bocchi is every introvert&rsquo;s ultimate form.</blockquote>

          <figcaption>The team went all out on Bocchi's chaos üòÇ</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>I&rsquo;m an introvert, and it&rsquo;s SO SATISFYING to see Bocchi just ‚Ä¶ be herself. All the awkwardness, avoidance, and nuisances - lovely.</p>
        <p>Not to mention: all the songs are incredible. I&rsquo;m still listening to some of my favorites up to this day:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>„Ç´„É©„Ç´„É©</li>
          <li>„ÇÆ„Çø„Éº„Å®Â≠§Áã¨„Å®Ëíº„ÅÑÊÉëÊòü</li>
          <li>ÈùíÊò•„Ç≥„É≥„Éó„É¨„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Çπ</li>
          <li>ÊòüÂ∫ß„Å´„Å™„Çå„Åü„Çâ</li>
        </ol>
        <p>OH YA - I&rsquo;m purchasing a guitar this summer too. Mainly inspired by Bocchi the Rock. There are so many anime / J-Pop songs I want to learn üò≠</p>

        <p></p>
        <p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk about Kaguya Sama.</p>
        <img src="article/kaguya 1.jpg" alt="miyuki whispering something to a surprised kaguya" width="100%" height="100%">
        <p>The best rom-com anime ever. Well, this might be very biased because this is literally the only one I&rsquo;ve watched. But man was Kaguya Sama good.</p>
        <img src="article/kaguya 2.jpg" alt="kaguya looking over miyuki's shoulder" width="100%" height="100%">
        <p>What I thought was just a simple romantic drama turned into‚Ä¶more of a mind battle tbh. It&rsquo;s all about the little, subtle details. It&rsquo;s all about who makes the move first. It&rsquo;s all about the use of words.</p>
        <blockquote>To see who wins in this game called love.</blockquote>
        <p>Also, the ending of season 3 is one of the most epic endings I&rsquo;ve seen. Masterpiece.</p>
        <p>Not to mention - the movie was amazing too. A very satisfying ending indeed. And one that makes me cry a bit inside knowing that there won&rsquo;t be any more Kaguya Sama anymore‚Ä¶</p>

        <h3>No.2 - Ranking of Kings üëë</h3>
        <img src="article/number 2.jpg" alt="bocchi looking over the cliff" width="100%" height="100%">
        <p>I admit - at first I was like</p>
        <blockquote>Is this an anime about a kid? How will this be interesting?</blockquote>
        <p>And man I was wrong.</p>
        <p>In my opinion, the beauty of ‚ÄúRanking of Kings‚Äù is the character design.</p>
        <p>There were so many moments in this anime where I was like</p>
        <blockquote>Hmm, this character seems very stereotypical‚Ä¶ Hmm, wait actually‚Ä¶. Oh man, I did not expect that and I&rsquo;m so glad I now understand this character a lot more.</blockquote>
        <figure>

          <figcaption>OP as hell</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Also, Boji is such a fascinating character. I just can&rsquo;t stop rooting for him. It feels damn good to see him succeed. And I LOVE the duo of Boji and Kage.</p>

        <p>If you want an extremely heart-warming anime with ups and downs, then Ranking of Kings is the one for you. It will warm your heart at the very end.</p>
        <p>And now‚Ä¶let&rsquo;s talk about my number 1.</p>

        <h3>No.1 - Cyberpunk Edgerunner üëæ</h3>
        <img src="article/number 1.jpg" alt="Lucy analyzing data next to David" width="100%" height="100%">
        <p>Oh man. Oh man. This one is a special one.</p>
        <p>Out of all of the anime I&rsquo;ve watched, this was the one that made me ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the most. The impact was‚Ä¶oof...</p>
        <blockquote>I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about the anime for four days after watching it.</blockquote>
        <p>Just imagine me sitting in my room. Playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvMY1uzSC1E&pp=ygUjaSByZWFsbHkgd2FudCB0byBzdGF5IGF0IHlvdXIgaG91c2U%3D" target="_blank">‚ÄúI Really Want to Stay at Your House‚Äù</a> on repeat. Staring into the void.</p>
        <p>It was just...</p>
        <p>SO</p>
        <p>DAMN</p>
        <p>SAD</p>
        <blockquote>Like - I just want David and Lucy to be on that moon together in the ending. THEY&rsquo;RE SO CUTE TOGETHER. Why is this so hard? WHY? WHY? WHY?</blockquote>
        <p>That final scene when Lucy sees David on the moon.</p>
        <blockquote>Soul officially crushed</blockquote>

        <p>I remember watching a fan art of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WESH4p6zzqE" target="_blank">‚Äúhappy ending.‚Äù</a>  I nearly teared up.</p>
        <p>But I guess that&rsquo;s the reality of night city. As much as I f*ing want it, it&rsquo;s not always a happy ending.</p>
        <p>Studio Trigger - hold my beer.</p>
